Use the API listed below to write your desired commands. Each command must be separated by a new line and end with a semicolon (";").
Use the file "init.txt" inside the service folder to place your commands.
If too many parameters are given to a command, only the first portion will be used. However, if not enough paramaters are given, the initialization will fail.

API:
  AddGuest(); \\ adds a guest to the system.
  Login(username, password); \\ logins a member into the system.
  Logout(username); \\ logs out the username from the system.
